<p> Video games have the potential to revolutionize adult education by offering immersive environments for studying difficult subjects.</p>
<p> Very few modern video games have lived up to this lofty goal, and Coddled Software is passionate about creating high-quality games that teach skills while entertaining.  The dream is that these games will be at least 50% entertainment, with enough educational content that users will feel that they are accomplishing something substantial.</p>

<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Us</h3>

<p>We have a detailed business plan, available for those interested in helping fund our vision.</p>

<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here are the current members of the team</h3>

<p>Danny Caudill has a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and has excellent presentation and written communication skills.  He has led several software projects while working for other companies, and has been developing software both commercially and as a hobby for over 10 years.  He understands the mechanics of a successful software team and has experience working with interdisciplinary teams such as successful video game design and development requires.  Graphic Artistry is one of his weaknesses, but he has developed applications using OpenGL and Unity 3D by leveraging the 3D models and 2D artwork of others.  He is obligated to his current full-time job until mid April 2015.  He will be available to work full-time at Coddled Software starting in May 2015.</p>
